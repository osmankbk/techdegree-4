1. I set the color of the game message to black if a player loses and red if wins using JQuery.
2. I set the div that contain the messages and the reset button when the game is over to fadein(1000) delay
  if lost and its background color to red, fadein(600) if won and its background color to green.
3. Set the reset button to fadein(2000) delay and set its color to red.
